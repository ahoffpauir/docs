{: #ref-index}
Last updated: 13 September 2016
{: .last-updated}

External service integration allows you to access data and operations from third-party or external services within your {{site.date.keyword.iot_full}} organization.

## Jasper
{: #jasper}

Jasper is an administration and management platform for SIM devices. Jasper is integrated into the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, making it possible to administer Jasper devices through your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization dashboard.

### Supported operations for Jasper

The built-in Jasper integration that is provided by our platform provides support for the following Jasper operations:

- View overall Jasper data
  - Shows: Status, Rate Plan, month-to-date data usage, month-to-date SMS usage, month-to-date voice usage, overage limits, date added, and date modified.
- Change SIM activation state.
  - Select from: Inventory, Activation Ready, Activated, Deactivated, and Retired.
- View SIM Usage
  - Shows: Cycle start date, billable and total data, billable and total SMS, billable and total voice.
  - The cycle start date can be set using a YYYY-MM-DD format.
- Send SMS to SIM
- Change rate plan

You can access the supported operations in the device drilldown of a Jasper connected device after the following configuration steps are completed.


### Configuration for Jasper

In order to connect your Jasper service to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization there are two stages of configuration that must first be done. First, your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} must be connected to your Jasper service, then your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} devices must be configured.


1. Enable the Jasper extension. To enable Jasper integration with your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization, complete the following steps:
  1. From the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, select **Extensions**.
  2. In the **Extensions** page, click **Add Extension**.
  3. Click **Add** next to Jasper.
  4. Enter your Jasper username, password, access key and domain ID.
  5. Click **Done**.

2. Configure your devices
You can configure the devices that are connected to both your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization and your Jasper account to display data from Jasper in the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard.  
**Important:** The Jasper configuration cannot be applied as part of the Add Device process, only previously connected devices can be configured with Jasper.  
To configure your Jasper-connected devices, complete the following steps:
 1. In the devices tab of your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, find the Jasper-connected device to be configured.
 2. Select the device to open the *Device Drilldown* view.
 3. Scroll down to *Extension Configuration*.
 4. Enter the extension configuration by using the following JSON format, and then click **Confirm changes** to save your configuration.  

```json  
    {
        "jasper": {
            "iccid": "string"
        }
    }

```

When the organization is successfully configured, the *Extensions* section displays under the *Extensions Configuration* section in the *Device Drilldown* view.

## ARM mbed connector
{: #arm}

The ARM mbed connector is an extension that allows you to connect your ARM mbed device to your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. The ARM mbed extension is allows the ARM mbed portal and the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} to send and receive data from the ARM mbed portal.

### Setup Configuration


1. Enable the ARM mbed connector extension. To enable the ARM mbed connector extension complete the following steps:
  1. From the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, select **Settings** and navigate to **Extensions**.
  2. In the **Extensions** menu, click **Add Extension**.
  3. Click **Add** next to ARM mbed connector extension.
  4. Enter your ARM mbed access key and domain ID. You can find these by using the ARM mbed portal at https://connector.mbed.com.
  5. Check the credentials are correct by clicking the **Check Connection** button.
  6. Click **Done**.

### Payload Format

There are two types of incoming messages from the ARM mbed platform, notifications and asynchronous responses. The {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} can send commands to devices that are connected to the ARM mbed platform.

#### Notifications

Notifications are generated by changes in device or sensor data. After the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} processes the message, it is to the device event topic in the same way as a device connected directly to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. The event type used for notifications originating on devices connected to the ARM mbed platform is `notify`.

The following code sample shows the payload format for a notification sent by the ARM mbed platform API:

```
{
  "ep":<endpoint/deviceID>,
  "path":<resource path>,
  "ct":<content type>,
  "payload":<Base64 encoded payload>,
  "max-age":<how long the payload is valid, in seconds>
}
```

#### Asynchronous responses

When the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} sends a command to a device connected to the ARM mbed platform, the device sends a confirmation message back to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. This confirmation message is called an _asynchronous response_ and uses the event type `asyncResponse`.

The following code sample shows the payload format for an asynchronous response sent by the ARM mbed cloud service:

```
{
  "id":<transaction id>,
  "status":<200 is command was sucessfully executed. Check other HTTP response codes>,
  "ct":<content type>,
  "max-age":<how long the payload is valid, in seconds>,
  "payload":<base64 encoded payload>,
  "ep":<endpoint/deviceID affected by the command>,
  "path":<resource path affected by the command>
}
```

#### Sending commands to the ARM mbed platform

The {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} can send commands to devices connected to the ARM mbed platform. Commands sent to the ARM mbed platform it must use the following JSON format.

```
{
  "method":<PUT or POST>,
  "deviceId":<endpoint/deviceId>,
  "resourceId":<resource path>,
  "payload": <Base64 encoded payload>
}
```

The payload should be published to the following topic:

```
iot-2/type/<device_type>/id/<deviceId>/cmd/<command_type>/fmt/<command_format>
```

The device management extension allows you to install custom functions for device management. For more information on custom device management functions, see [device management custom extensions](../../devices/device_mgmt/custom_actions.html){: new_window}.

## Blockchain
{: #blockchain}

{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} with blockchain enables IoT devices to provide data to blockchain transactions, which stores the data in the blockchain's immutable ledger and uses it in smart contract business rules. {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} maps device data to the data format that is required by the blockchain's smart contract and passes it to a blockchain fabric to store in the blockchain ledger.

### Supported operations for Blockchain
- Trigger smart contract updates with device events.
- Run smart contract business logic to update ledger state with device event data.
- Monitor the blockchain, transactions, and ledger state with the monitoring UI.

### Configuration for Blockchain

{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} blockchain integration is a services offering  that is not activated by default in {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}}. To activate the feature in your environment, complete the following steps:
 1. From the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard, select **Settings** and navigate to **Extensions**.
 2. Click the **Tell me more** link next to the Blockchain extension to go to the IoT Blockchain Services Offering page.
 3. Fill out and submit the service request form.   
The service approval typically takes approximately one day. After your request is approved, you receive an email with instructions on how to activate blockchain integration in your {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} organization.
 5. Return to the {{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} dashboard for your organization to complete the setup. For more information, see [{{site.data.keyword.iot_short_notm}} blockchain integration](../../bl_blockchain_integration.html).
